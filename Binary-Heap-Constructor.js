//Max (or min) Binary Heaps have the property of parents having at max 2
//child elements. A unique property is that it the parent elements will always
//be larger than child elements. We can store this as a tree which visually makes
// a lot of sense. We can use a tree, however we can also use a built in data
//structure to simplify. That data structure is an array.
//The tricky part is how do we know which elements are in parents to which nodes?
//Using some math, we can store elements by appending them to the end of an array
//if Parent elements have a index of n, then children nodes will always be at
// 2n+1 or 2n+2. Alternatively, children nodes will have parent nodes at
//Math.floor(n/2).
//Now we can insert and remove at O(logn) time.
