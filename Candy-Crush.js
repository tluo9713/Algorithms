//https://leetcode.com/problems/candy-crush/

//This question is about implementing a basic elimination algorithm for Candy Crush.

//Given a 2D integer array board representing the grid of candy, different
//positive integers board[i][j] represent different types of candies. A value of
//board[i][j] = 0 represents that the cell at position (i, j) is empty. The
//given board represents the state of the game following the player's move. Now,
//you need to restore the board to a stable state by crushing candies according
//to the following rules:

//If three or more candies of the same type are adjacent vertically or
//horizontally, "crush" them all at the same time - these positions become
//empty.After crushing all candies simultaneously, if an empty space on the
//board has candies on top of itself, then these candies will drop until they
//hit a candy or bottom at the same time. (No new candies will drop outside the
//top boundary.)
//After the above steps, there may exist more candies that can be crushed. If so,
//you need to repeat the above steps.
//If there does not exist more candies that can be crushed (ie. the board is
//stable), then return the current board.
//You need to perform the above rules until the board becomes stable, then
//return the current board.
