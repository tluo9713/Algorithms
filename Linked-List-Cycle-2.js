//This problem could be solved easily by having a hash table that records
//every value we have seen. Then when we see a value we have seen before, we can
//return that value and we have our solution. This is O(n) time and O(n) space
//as we have to store every node we seen. There is a slightly more optimized
//solution for space. What if we had two pointers, and one pointer moves at
//a speed of 2 nodes, while the other pointer moves only one node at a time.
//This technique is known as the tortoise and the hare.
//If the fast node ever reaches null, we know this is not a cycle. If there is
//a cycle, there will be an overlap at some point where both pointers point to
//the same node. This node isn't always guarenteed to be the start of the cycle.
//What you could do is move one of the pointers back to the head and move both
//pointers at the speed of one node at a time, and then when they overlap, they
//will ALWAYS be at the start of the cycle. The proof of this is beyond the
//scope of this algo, but there is a nice visual way of proving this.
